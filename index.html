        <h3> About Evelyn </h3>
        <hr> <!-- mostly for theme consistency -->
        <p>I've grown up all over the U.S., though I was born in Battle Creek, Michigan. Bouncing from state to state at a young age, i've learned to adapt to whatever produces the best environment, from reccess games to semester projects!</p> <!-- L/R padding? -->
        <p>I've always loved computers, relying on them when my world would change. As such, Software Development was always appealing to me. My love of the digital world mixing with my inquisitive nature, it only makes sense I go into a problem-solving tech career!</p>
